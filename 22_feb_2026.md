#### Layout and rendering
The layout of a web page is typically specified by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Each style sheet is a series of rules for how the page should be presented. For example, some rules specify typography details, such as font, color, and text size, while others determine the placement of images. The engine combines all relevant CSS rules to calculate precise graphical coordinates and pixel values for the visual representation it will paint on the screen.

The engine updates the visual representation in response to new events, including the user scrolling the page, content being asynchronously fetched, video playback, and canvas animations. It also may begin rendering before a page's resources are downloaded, which can result in visual changes as more data is received, such as images being gradually filled in or a flash of unstyled content.

|v8|bsd-3-clause|esnext|yes|yes|c++|JavaScript engine of Google Chrome and Chromium/Blink-based browsers, such as Microsoft Edge. Also used in Node.js and Deno runtimes, Electron framework and numerous other projects. Currently has a register-based bytecode interpreter (Ignition) and three tiers of JIT compilers (Sparkplug, Maglev and Turbofan).|
|spidermonkey|mpl-2.0|esnext|yes|yes|c++|JavaScript engine of Firefox and other Mozilla Gecko applications. The engine currently includes interpreter, 2-tier JIT for JavaScript (Baseline Compiler and WarpMonkey), and a separate 2-tier JIT for WebAssembly.[19] Previously, the engine included components such as the TraceMonkey compiler (first JavaScript JIT), JägerMonkey, IonMonkey, as well as OdinMonkey optimization module notable for pioneering asm.js.[25]|
|javascriptcore|lgpl-2.0|esnext|yes|yes|c++|JavaScript engine of Safari and WebKit-based browsers. Also used in Bun runtime. Started out in 2001 as a fork of KJS engine. In 2008 the engine was rewritten to use a direct-threaded register-based bytecode interpreter, codenamed SquirrelFish. Shortly after, SquirrelFish Extreme (Nitro in Apple's marketing terms)[29] was released, achieving over 2x speedup over it by using polymorphic inline caching and context threading[30] – a basic form of JIT.[31] These components later became LLint bytecode interpreter and Baseline JIT.[32] In 2011, the first optimizing compiler was added – DFG ("Data Flow Graph") JIT.[32][33] In 2014, an advanced LLVM-based compiler was added, dubbed Fourth Tier LLVM (FTL) JIT.[34] In 2016, FTL was rewritten to use a newly built B3 backend instead of LLVM.|
|chakracore|mit|es2019|yes|yes|c++|JavaScript engine of Microsoft Edge Legacy.[36] Open-sourced under the name ChakraCore in 2016. Microsoft discontinued maintenance in 2021, leaving it to the community, but it has received little attention since then. It features a register-based bytecode interpreter and a two-tier JIT compiler.[20]|
