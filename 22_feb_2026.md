#### Layout and rendering
The layout of a web page is typically specified by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Each style sheet is a series of rules for how the page should be presented. For example, some rules specify typography details, such as font, color, and text size, while others determine the placement of images. The engine combines all relevant CSS rules to calculate precise graphical coordinates and pixel values for the visual representation it will paint on the screen.

The engine updates the visual representation in response to new events, including the user scrolling the page, content being asynchronously fetched, video playback, and canvas animations. It also may begin rendering before a page's resources are downloaded, which can result in visual changes as more data is received, such as images being gradually filled in or a flash of unstyled content.
